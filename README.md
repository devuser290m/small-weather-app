The weather app project I've created is a dynamic and user-friendly application built using a combination of JavaScript, CSS, React, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. This innovative app provides users with up-to-date weather information in an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Leveraging the power of React, it offers seamless interactivity and real-time updates, ensuring that users can access accurate weather forecasts with ease. The use of Tailwind CSS not only enhances the app's aesthetics but also guarantees a responsive design for various screen sizes, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
Important to mention that the API used in the project (open weather api) it is not entirely accurate. For example, there's a 10 to 15 minutes (in some case) difference from the actual time searched for. Temperature is accurate.
